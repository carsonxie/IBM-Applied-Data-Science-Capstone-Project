    "Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"

    "- Based on the scores of the Test Set, we can not confirm which method perfoms best.\n",
    "- Same Test Set scores may be due to the small test sample size (18 samples). Therefore, we tested all methods based on the whole Dataset.\n",
    "- The scores of the whole Dataset confirm that the best model is the Decision Tree Model. This model has not only higher scores, but also the highest accuracy."
